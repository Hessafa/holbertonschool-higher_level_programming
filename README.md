# holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

This repository contains projects and exercises focused on mastering higher-level programming concepts, primarily using **Python**. The goal is to build a strong foundation in Python programming, with attention to coding style, logic, and problem-solving skills. Each project introduces specific concepts such as control flow, loops, functions, string manipulation, object-oriented programming, and interactions with system tools or external resources.

This is part of the Holberton School curriculum, which emphasizes hands-on, peer-driven learning and real-world programming practices. All projects are designed to be run and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.*), and follow the official Python style guide enforced by `pycodestyle`.
