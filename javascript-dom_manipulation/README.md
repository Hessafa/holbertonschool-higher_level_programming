# JavaScript - DOM Manipulation
This project demonstrates how to dynamically interact with web page elements using JavaScript. We explored how to select and update DOM elements, handle events, and fetch data from APIs — all without reloading the page.

## What We Learned
How to select HTML elements using querySelector, ID, class, and tag selectors

How to update element styles and content using JavaScript

How to respond to user actions with event listeners

How to manipulate the DOM in real time

How to fetch data using fetch() and display it on the page
